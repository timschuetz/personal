I'm a PhD researcher in the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Irvine. My research and teaching focus on ways data are mobilized for different purposes in different settings â€“ across scientific fields, as evidence in legal cases, and as shared points of references in social movements, for example.

I study how data practices change, the infrastructures and ideologies that shape them, and the contexts in which data gains or loses analytic and political power. I both study and help build robust public knowledge infrastructure, working with advocacy organizations, museums, public libraries, and other creative data practitioners.

For my dissertation, I co-develop the [Formosa Plastics Global Archive](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/formosa-plastics-global-archive-%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%A1%91%E8%86%A0%E6%AA%94%E6%A1%88%E9%A4%A8/essay), a digital collection that supports a transnational network of people concerned about the operations of the Formosa Plastics Corporation, one of the world's largest petrochemical companies.

I'm a member of the Design Group for the [Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography](www.worldpece.org) (PECE) and publish a community newsletter for which you can sign up [here](https://github.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=28f50ca38ef652df957d5cbd6&id=0ed4893b1f).
